##  Week 1 Problems

###  1. Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

**Problem:**  
Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array (no duplicates).

**Concept Used:**  
Binary Search. The key idea is to find the pivot point where rotation happens, which is also the minimum element.

**Example:**  
Input: `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`  
Output: `1`

###  2. Ruby Second House

**Problem:**  
A robber can’t rob two adjacent houses. Given an array where each element represents the amount in a house, find the maximum amount that can be robbed without robbing two adjacent houses.

**Concept Used:**  
Dynamic Programming – similar to the "House Robber" problem.

**Example:**  
Input: `[2, 7, 9, 3, 1]`  
Output: `12` (Rob house 1 and 3)

###  3. Subarray Sum Equals K

**Problem:**  
Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.

**Concept Used:**  
Prefix Sum + Hash Map to track cumulative sums efficiently.

**Example:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3], k = 3`  
Output: `2` (subarrays `[1,2]` and `[3]`)
